# Python Implementation of Dynamic Mode Decomposition

This python code illustrates how to apply Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to univariate time series forecasting tasks.

Two examples are provided here.

For the explanation of DMD, please refer to this HackMD notes: [Dynamic Mode Decomposition](https://hackmd.io/@mklan/HyLXh7UH_).

The major reference is this arXiv article: [On Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Theory and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0041).

To experiment with the examples, run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python dmd_example01.py
python dmd_example02.py
```
