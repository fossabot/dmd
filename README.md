# Python Implementation of Dynamic Mode Decomposition

This notebook illustrates how to apply Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to univariate time series forecasting tasks.

Two examples are provided here,

For the explanation of DMD, please refer to this HackMD notes: [Dynamic Mode Decomposition](https://hackmd.io/@mklan/HyLXh7UH_).
